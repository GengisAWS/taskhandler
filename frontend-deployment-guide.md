# Frontend Deployment Guide

This guide explains how to deploy the DevFlow frontend application, which is built using Create React App.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed
- Access to a hosting platform (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, or traditional web hosting)

## Build Steps

1. First, install all dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

2. Create a production build:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   This will create a `build` directory with optimized production files.

## Deployment Options

### 1. Vercel (Recommended)
Vercel offers the easiest deployment experience for React applications:

1. Install Vercel CLI:
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. Deploy:
   ```bash
   vercel
   ```

### 2. Netlify
Another excellent option for React deployments:

1. Install Netlify CLI:
   ```bash
   npm install -g netlify-cli
   ```

2. Deploy:
   ```bash
   netlify deploy
   ```

### 3. Traditional Web Hosting
If using traditional web hosting:

1. After running `npm run build`, upload the contents of the `build` directory to your web server's public directory.
2. Ensure your web server is configured to serve `index.html` for all routes (for client-side routing).

## Environment Variables
If your application uses environment variables:

1. Create a `.env` file in the frontend directory
2. Add your environment variables prefixed with `REACT_APP_`
3. Make sure to configure these in your hosting platform's settings

## Post-Deployment Verification

1. Verify that your application loads correctly
2. Test all main features and routes
3. Check that API connections work as expected

## Notes

- The application is configured for modern browsers as specified in `package.json`'s browserslist
- Production builds are optimized and minified for best performance
- Static assets are included in the build directory
