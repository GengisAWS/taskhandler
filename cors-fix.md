# CORS Fix Implementation

The CORS issue has been resolved by:

1. Adding CORS headers to all Lambda function responses, including:
   - Success responses (200, 201, 204)
   - Error responses (400, 404, 500)
   - All responses include:
     ```json
     headers: {
       'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*',
       'Access-Control-Allow-Methods': '*',
       'Access-Control-Allow-Headers': '*'
     }
     ```

2. The CORS configuration has been implemented in:
   - create-task Lambda
   - get-tasks Lambda
   - update-task Lambda
   - delete-task Lambda

3. All edge cases are covered:
   - Success responses
   - Validation errors
   - Not found errors
   - Server errors
   - Empty responses (204)

The API should now be accessible from the CloudFront domain (https://dmmp2t4jbu3j4.cloudfront.net).

Note: While this implementation uses '*' for CORS headers which allows all origins, methods, and headers, in a production environment you may want to restrict these to specific values for better security.
